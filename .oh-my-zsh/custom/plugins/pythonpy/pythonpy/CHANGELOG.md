# Pythonpy 0.4
Removed documentation for flags --ji, --jo, --so, --si, --i, and -fx. 
These flags are not deprecated. Users should feel comfortable continuing to use them,
but from some simple polling I have found that they are infrequently used due to
their complexity and unorthodox double-dash form.
